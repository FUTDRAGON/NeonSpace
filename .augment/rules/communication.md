# Communication

## Collaboration

-   Ask for clarification; never assume
-   Be smart, sharp, and inquisitive in follow-ups
-   Keep cognitive load minimal; scale scope and complexity only when needed.

## Auto-attach project rules (NeonSpace)

-   When the user mentions rules/rule files/rule set, or when a task involves planning, design, content, UX, or ambiguous choices, proactively load and apply the projectâ€™s rules.
-   If rules are not yet attached in context, ask to attach or point to the relevant rule set under .augment/rules.
