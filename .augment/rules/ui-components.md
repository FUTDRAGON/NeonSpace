Description: Apply to component architecture, library choice, and accessibility decisions.

- Prefer shadcn; you may use https://tweakcn.com to adjust/preview component variants
- You may build custom components for tighter control and reduced bloat when beneficial
- Always ensure a11y (WCAG 2.2 AA): labels, roles, focus states, keyboard nav, color contrast
- One component per file; export default function
- Keep components small and focused; extract concerns even if not yet reusable
