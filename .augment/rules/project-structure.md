# Project Structure
Description: Apply to imports, file layout, and code readability.

- Use absolute imports via alias (base at src). The alias symbol will be configured during project init
- Source layout under src/{types,hooks,components}; scope locally (file/folder/parent) unless widely reused
- Use newline separation between logical code blocks for readability (DX)
