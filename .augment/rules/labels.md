# Labels (NeonSpace)

## Style

- Bold, themed, capitalized names; avoid parentheses in names.
- Choose dark-mode friendly deep colors (wine reds, deep blues/greens/oranges).

## Sources of truth

- Treat recommended-labels.txt and the CONTRIBUTING.md Labels Guide as the canonical references for label names and meanings.
- When automating label management, ensure names and semantics match those sources.
