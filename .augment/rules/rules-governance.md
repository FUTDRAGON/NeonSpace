# Rules Governance

- Before editing or creating rule files, read all files in .augment/rules to ensure accurate grouping and avoid conflicts.
- Keep rules scoped by domain; do not mix unrelated topics. If overlap occurs, link to the other file rather than duplicating content.
- If a rule does not fit an existing file, create a new file with a precise description in the frontmatter.
- After changes, quickly review neighboring files for consistency.
