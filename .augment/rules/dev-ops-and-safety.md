# DevOps & Safety

## Commands & Packages

-   Always use pnpm for commands
-   Never edit package.json scripts/dependencies manually; use pnpm commands

## Safety

-   Do not run git commands without explicit permission
-   Exception: read-only git status/diff allowed when crafting commit messages (see Commit Messages rules).

## Analytics

-   See "Documentation & Analytics (NeonSpace)" rules for analytics widgets and links.

## Context & Retrieval

-   When working on something "specific", refresh knowledge with Context7 MCP before proposing changes
