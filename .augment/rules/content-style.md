# Content Style (NeonSpace)

## Writing

- Avoid em dashes; use proper hyphenation for compound adjectives (e.g., 'user-centric'). Prefer commas instead of em dashes.
- In Markdown, write one sentence per line for readability; avoid wrapped multi-sentence paragraphs.

## Editing constraints

- In this repository, do not edit Markdown files in the repository root (they are symlinked).
- Always edit their sources under Markdown/ or the appropriate subdirectory instead.
