# Documentation & Content Standards

## Writing style

- Avoid em dashes; use proper hyphenation for compound adjectives (e.g., 'user-centric'). Prefer commas instead of em dashes.
- In Markdown, write one sentence per line for readability; avoid wrapped multi-sentence paragraphs.

## Editing constraints

- In this repository, do not edit Markdown files in the repository root (they are symlinked).
- Always edit their sources under Markdown/ or the appropriate subdirectory instead.

## Documentation (READMEs/docs)

- Use a captivating but not over-hyped tone.
- Include dynamic badges at the top.
- Prefer dark-mode stat widgets everywhere except Repobeats (keep Repobeats as-is).
- Always include a Ko-fi badge linking to https://ko-fi.com/neonsy.

## Analytics

- Use Repobeats, OSS Insight, and Star History.
- OSS Insight link format: https://ossinsight.io/analyze/<owner>/<repo>#overview
- Star History: prefer dark-mode charts when available.
- Keep Repobeats in its default style.

## Labels (NeonSpace)

### Style

- Bold, themed, capitalized names; avoid parentheses in names.
- Choose dark-mode friendly deep colors (wine reds, deep blues/greens/oranges).

### Sources of truth

- Treat recommended-labels.txt and the CONTRIBUTING.md Labels Guide as the canonical references for label names and meanings.
- When automating label management, ensure names and semantics match those sources.
