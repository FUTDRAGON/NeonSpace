# Governance & Collaboration

## Collaboration

- Ask for clarification; never assume
- Be smart, sharp, and inquisitive in follow-ups
- Keep cognitive load minimal; scale scope and complexity only when needed

## Auto-attach project rules (NeonSpace)

- When the user mentions rules/rule files/rule set, or when a task involves planning, design, content, UX, or ambiguous choices, proactively load and apply the project's rules
- If rules are not yet attached in context, ask to attach or point to the relevant rule set under .kilocode/rules

## Rules governance

- Before editing or creating rule files, read all files in .kilocode/rules to ensure accurate grouping and avoid conflicts
- Keep rules scoped by domain; do not mix unrelated topics. If overlap occurs, link to the other file rather than duplicating content
- If a rule does not fit an existing file, create a new file with a precise description in the frontmatter
- After changes, quickly review neighboring files for consistency
